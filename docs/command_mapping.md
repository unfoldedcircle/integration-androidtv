- Available Android remote keycodes are defined in: https://github.com/tronikos/androidtvremote2/blob/v0.0.14/src/androidtvremote2/remotemessage.proto#L90

## Device Profiles

Unfortunately the keycode support of Android TV devices is very limited and device- (and probably even app-) specific.

Device profiles allow better support of the available features and different key-mappings:

- Definition of available [media-player features](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/core-api/blob/main/doc/entities/entity_media_player.md#features).
- Definition of additional simple commands, which either specify a keycode or map a command:
  - Android remote keycode name, starting with `KEYCODE_`, for example: `"KEYCODE_F12"`.
  - Android remote keycode as string, for example: `"142"`. This is intended for testing, see below.
  - Uppercase name which maps to a keycode and optional key action (`SHORT`, `LONG`, `DOUBLE_CLICK`).

Available profiles:

- Google Chromecast with Google TV, HD and 4k: [Google_Chromecast.json](../config/profiles/Google_Chromecast.json)
- NVIDIA SHIELD TV (Pro): [NVIDIA_SHIELD.json](../config/profiles/NVIDIA_SHIELD.json)
- Default, if no profile matches: [default.json](../config/profiles/default.json)

Pull requests for additional devices are greatly appreciated. 

### Device Profile Matching

Profiles are matched based on manufacturer name and device model, which is returned in the
[device information](https://github.com/tronikos/androidtvremote2/blob/v0.0.14/src/androidtvremote2/androidtv_remote.py#L101)
from the androidtvremote2 library.

Each device profile is defined in a separate json file in [config/profiles](../config/profiles). All profiles are read
during driver startup and sorted alphabetically.

- Manufacturer and model fields in the profile file are treated as prefixes.
- Matching against the returned information from the device is performed case-insensitive.
- Manufacturer is mandatory, model is optional (empty field).

For example: profile `manufacturer = "foo"`, `model = "bar"` will match the following device information:

- foo / bar
- FOO / Bart
- Foot / Barista


## Testing Keycodes

To simplify testing and identifying working keycodes, the [available keycodes](https://github.com/tronikos/androidtvremote2/blob/v0.0.14/src/androidtvremote2/remotemessage.proto#L90)
can be sent directly with the Core-API to the Remote Two or Core Simulator.
Either as name (including the `KEYCODE_` prefix), or as numeric value string.

Example:
```console
curl --location --request PUT '$IP/api/entities/uc_androidtv_driver.main.012345678912/command' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-u web-configurator:$PIN \
--data '{"cmd_id": "KEYCODE_TAB"}'
```

With numeric keycode: `{"cmd_id": "61"}`
